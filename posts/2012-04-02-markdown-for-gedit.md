le playing with tumblr configuration I've found out that one can choose *markdown* as the post edition format. However editing posts directly in the backend isn't the most convenient method so I've made a little research of what I can use locally.

A little markdown plugin for gedit, made by Jean-Philippe Fleury seems great, so I'll stick with it for a moment. Here's the link if you'd like to download it: http://www.jpfleury.net/en/software/gedit-markdown.php (detailed installation instructions are also available there).

Remember that the **markdown preview** works only for files with markdown extensions (\*.md, \*.markdown, \*.mkd). In my case specifying file syntax type from gedit menu didn't work, so if the preview doesn't show up - try to rename your file.
